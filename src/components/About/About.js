        <p className={classes.text}>
          Hello, I'm Kevin Alejandrino, a dedicated front-end react developer
          with a strong desire to learn and grow in the field of web
          development.
        </p>
        <p className={classes.text}>
          I discovered my love for web development during my studies and quickly
          realized that it was the perfect blend of creativity and
          problem-solving. With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
          I am eager to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge in
          front-end development.
        </p>
        <p className={classes.text}>
          I enjoy turning wireframes and mockups into responsive and visually
          appealing websites. I am proficient in utilizing tools such as Figma
          and frameworks like React to enhance the user experience and optimize
          the development process.
        </p>
        <p className={classes.text}>
